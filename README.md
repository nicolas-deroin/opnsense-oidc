# OpenID Connect for OPNsense
This package will allow you and your administrators to login to the OPNsense dashboard with a OpenID Connect provider.

# Installation
To ensure that you're pulling the latest changes, recommended approach is to directly clone the repository directly onto your OPNSense machine and build it from there

A shell script `install_opnsense_oidc.sh` is included in the repo to assist with the post-download installation

If `git` is not already installed on your OPNSense machine (i.e., `git --version` returns "Command not found"), it can be added via
```
pkg install git
```
Once `git` is installed (or if it's already available), run the following as a sudo-enabled user:
```
cd ~ \ # optional command to ensure you're in your user's home directory
git clone git@github.com:nicolas-deroin/opnsense-oidc.git \ # To download via SSH
git clone https://github.com/nicolas-deroin/opnsense-oidc.git \ # To download via HTTPS
sudo chmod +x ./opnsense-oidc/install_opnsense_oidc.sh \
sudo ./opnsense-oidc/install_opnsense_oidc.sh
```

The shell script will handle all file movement, building, and installing the final package. Once the shell script exits, you should have opnsense-oidc available in your OPNSense console

## Configuration
### Provider Url
This is a link to the provider. The URL will need to have `/.well-known/openid-configuration` available for discovery.

### Client ID
The provided ID from your OIDC provider

### Client Secret
The secret from your OIDC provider

### Username Claim
The field from the user payload that contains the username.

### Scopes
Scopes to request form the OIDC Provider. For example, `openid`, `email`, `profile`.

### Automatic user creation
When a user logins and does not have a matching user account in the local database, this will create a new user.  This is to be used in conjunction with `Default Groups`

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended to keep this disabled. Your firewall isn't a service that should readily accept new users.

### Default Groups
When a new user is created, these groups will be assigned to them.

### Icon Url
An optional URL that will be proxied for the login button. You can access it at `/api/oidc/auth/icon?provider=<name>`

### Custom Button 
When provided, the button will be replaced with the custom one. 
There are several templates available:
- `%name%` Name of the provider 
- `%url%` URL that will start the auth flow
- `%icon%` The proxied icon image (useful to avoid CORS).

As an example, here is one that makes a nice big icon next to the login button
```html
<a href="%url%" class="btn btn-primary"><img src="%icon%" style="height: 2em"> Login with %name%</a> 
<style>.login-sso-link-container { display: flex; justify-content: end; margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 9px; }</style>
```

## Mapping
Users being logged in are mapped against the `preferred_username` claim and are checked against the local database's username and email fields.

There is no group maaping at this stage.

# Development
## VScode
To get VSCode to behave correctly with the OPNSense PHP, we will need to tell the language server where to find the classes we use.
I use [Intelephense](https://intelephense.com/) for work, and this is easy to configure with the `includePaths` setting. 

There are several parts we need:
1. [opnsense/core](https://github.com/opnsense/core)
   - This handles all the core functionality with OPNSense
2. [phalcon/ide-stubs](https://github.com/phalcon/ide-stubs)
   - OPNSense uses the [Phalcon](https://docs.phalcon.io/3.4/introduction/) framework, and this is a stubs library specifically for this use case. 

Once these are cloned into a repository, you can configure Intelephense to use them:
```json
{
    "intelephense.environment.includePaths": [
        "D:\\projects\\opnsense\\core\\src\\opnsense\\mvc",
        "D:\\projects\\opnsense\\core\\src\\etc\\inc",
        "D:\\projects\\opnsense\\core\\src\\www",
        "D:\\projects\\opnsense\\ide-stubs\\src"
    ],
    "explorer.compactFolders": false,
    "files.associations": {
        "*.inc": "php",
    }
}
```

## Setup on OPNSense
Here are the steps i have gotten to work with setup.

1. Clone [opnsense/plugins](https://github.com/opnsense/plugins) to `/usr/plugins`
2. Clone [opnsense/tools](https://github.com/opnsense/tools) to `/usr/tools`
3. `cd /usr/tools` and `make update`
4. `make plugins` (this might not be required. This will take a long time and tends to crash at libpam. I abort at this time )
5. Clone your project to `~/project-name`
6. Copy the project's content to `/usr/plugins/devel/project-name`
7. Build with `cd /usr/plugins/devel/project-name && make package`
8. Install `pkg add /usr/plugins/devel/project-name/work/pkg/*.pkg`
